# DeepSeeButtons
Script used by the DeepSee support group at InterSystems to gather system information. 

Import DeepSeeButtons.mac to the %SYS namespace. However, if your Caché version does not support the new UDL formatting (it should be Caché 2016.1 and below) import DeepSeeButtons.xml. Launch DeepSeeButtons from terminal as:

`%SYS>Do ^DeepSeeButtons`

Then follow the prompts.
